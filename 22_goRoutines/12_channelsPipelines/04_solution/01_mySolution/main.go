/*
CHALLENGE #1:
-- Change the code above to execute 100 factorial computations concurrently
and in parallel.
-- Use the "pipeline" pattern to accomplish this

-- What realizations did you have about working with concurrent code when
building your solution?
-- eg, what insights did you have which helped you understand working with
concurrency?
